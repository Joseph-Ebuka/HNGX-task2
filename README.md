# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## How To Run The Project Locally

After cloning or forking the site properly, run the development server:
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install


```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing this file in your App.jsx;
